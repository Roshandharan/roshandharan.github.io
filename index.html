      <h1>Roshan Dharan <span class="accent">Shashidharan</span></h1>
      <p>
        I am a Master’s student in Computer Science (Data Science) at the University of Southern California, with a strong
        foundation in software engineering, data analytics, and healthcare technology. I currently work as a Software
        Engineering Intern at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, where I contribute to building and improving
        healthcare-focused software and data systems that support clinical research and medical initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously at Oracle Health, I delivered custom healthcare data reporting and analytics solutions for large-scale
        clients, including Children’s National Hospital (Washington, DC). My work leveraged SQL, BI automation, and cloud
        platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, AWS, GCP, and OCI, supporting NIH-backed studies, predictive analytics
        efforts, and enterprise BI migration initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been honored with the Oracle Pinnacle Award, Champion of Service Award, Round of Applause, and multiple
        Spot Awards, reflecting a proven track record of solving complex problems and driving measurable impact in
        high-stakes healthcare environments.
